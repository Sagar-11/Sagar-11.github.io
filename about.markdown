Personal webpage where I share a few interesting notes from my research and projects.

Taking inspiration from Erd≈ës's idea of 'The Book,' a fabled collection where the gods of mathematics have a record of the most beautiful proofs, I beleive that such a Book must exist for all things beautiful too. This blog is my attempt at accesing some of the pages of this Book. Each Post, a footnote of my current understanding. Feel free to write to me if you notice any issues or want to share something interesting. Thank You!
